# Design Pattern

This repository contains the solutions for the Design Patterns course labs. Each lab focuses on different design principles or patterns. Below is the description of each lab:

## Lab01: SOLID Principles
In this lab, we applied the **SOLID principles** to improve code structure and maintainability. The SOLID principles are:
- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle

This lab focuses on refactoring a given codebase to adhere to these principles, ensuring better flexibility and reduced coupling.

## Lab02: Strategy Pattern
This lab focuses on implementing the **Strategy Pattern**, a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. 
The lab demonstrates how to:
- Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
- Use different algorithms without altering the context in which they're used.

Example use cases include sorting algorithms, disk scheduling algorithms, and other operations where the logic may vary dynamically.

## Lab03: Observer Pattern
In this lab, the **Observer Pattern** is implemented. This pattern allows an object (subject) to notify other objects (observers) about state changes, typically used for implementing event-driven systems.
Key concepts covered in this lab include:
- **Subject**: The object being observed.
- **Observer**: The object(s) observing and reacting to changes in the subject.
- Real-world examples such as UI event handling and data monitoring.

Each lab includes the code solution and test cases for the given design pattern or principle. Feel free to explore and experiment with each implementation.
